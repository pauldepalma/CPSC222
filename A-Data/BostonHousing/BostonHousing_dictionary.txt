It might be interesting to look at the original paper, cited below, to see how econometric
researchers in the late seventies interpreted so-called racial data.   Such an 
investigation, though important, is outside the scope of this course.  It is also 
interesting to note that the paper has been widely cited over years in books and papers 
on machine learning and data-driven engineering. 

• lstat (LowerStatusPercent)

• medv (MedianValue)

Short Description and Reference
================================
The Boston Housing dataset contains information collected by the U.S. Census
Service about housing in the Boston metropolitan area during the 1970s. It
records demographic, economic, and environmental factors for 506 census
tracts, and is commonly used to demonstrate regression modeling and
feature relationships in statistics and machine learning.
